         <h4 class="h-bold" style="margin-top:0px">Treatment of gum diseases</h4>
         <p style="text-align: justify">Periodontology is a field specialized in the treatment of gums and the parodontium. The parodontium is made of tissues that surround the teeth: bones, fibres that bind the teeth to the bone and the gum. The diseases of the parodontium are caused by bacterial inflammation. Accumulative plaque on the surface of the tooth is a bacterial source that leads to destructive inflammation in a susceptible body. This pain-free inflammation is initially limited to the level of gums and then spreads to the bones and the fibres the secure the teeth, destroying these structures. This process may remain undetected (even for many years) until tooth migration, tooth release or tooth decay does not draw the patient's attention to the inflammation. The primary symptoms of the parodontium disease are bleeding gums, swelling of the gums, unpleasant breath, widening of the space between teeth, tooth loosening.
            <br><br>Most patients with gum disease report bleeding gums, mobility of teeth, or mild pain. Unfortunately, these symptoms are typical of advanced disease in most cases. Therefore it is important for us to educate our patients about the most typical symptoms and to also stop this progress by prevention.
            <br><br>Dental diseases can be diagnosed by screening tests. Dental disease can be determined not only by a specialist doctor but also by a dentist working in general practice. However, the treatment should be entrusted to a specialist, a so-called periodontologist.
            <br><br>This is a treatable and curable disease. However, the tissue that is destroyed as a result of inflammation can rarely be restored to its original state. A realistic result is the healing of the inflammation and the preservation of state after healing. It is important to emphasize that, since the problem of dental disease is caused by susceptible individuals, maintenance treatment of the tooth is still necessary after recovery, so it requires a lifetime of dedicated care from both the patient and the specialist.
            <br><br>The purpose of the periodontology treatments is to keep natural teeth in the oral cavity as long as possible and in a functional condition. The basis of the treatment is the removal of the plaque in order to reduce the bacterial mass that causes the inflammation. In order to maintain a clean oral cavity, good dental practice at home is absolutely necessary. If oral hygiene is not adequate, the therapy cannot be successful.
            <br><br>Periodontal therapy has several treatment stages but the sequence of the treatment is always the same. The severity of the dental disease determines the level of therapy that the patient has to reach for a complete recovery. The therapy of the inflammation of parodontium is a time-consuming process so it requires patience and commitment. Treatment and recovery periods vary throughout the therapy.
            <br><br>Like most diseases, parodontium inflammations are easier to prevent than to treat. The most important means of prevention are regular dental examinations, professional dental hygiene treatment and professional dental care at home.
            <br><br>Periodontology also covers the correction of gums. Most often, the detachment of the gum from the tooth called recession can cause discomfort. Sometimes, however, too thick gums can be the cause of aesthetic problems. There's a solution to both by appropriate surgical corrections.
