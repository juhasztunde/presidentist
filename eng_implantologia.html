         <p style="text-align: justify">Dental implants are placed in the jaw bone to replace the missing natural teeth. Implants can be placed in each tooth, replacing them individually, but the implanted artificial roots can also hold bridges together, or they can be used to anchor removable replacements. The results achieved are closely related to the initial situation of the patient.
            <br><br>If the existing toothlessness comes with a small amount of bone loss, then we can expect a perfect or similar result to the original state with a small cosmetic compromise at max. If the long-standing toothlessness has resulted in severe bone loss, as a result of implantation a stable denture is prepared, that is aesthetically perfect in areas which are visible to others, but due to its design to make cleaning easier, the neck of the implant which is near to the gums is recognisable and in some cases it is hidden by gingival mask (artificial gums).
            <br><br>The lifetime of implants after healing depends primarily on hygienic factors, such as the patient's home dental care. In all cases, it is necessary to use specially designed dental cleaning tools and mouthwash.
            <br><br>The doctor will inform the patient about the results that can be expected after the artificial root transplantation, but also he or she will talk about the consequences of not replacing the tooth. We will inform you about all the alternative options and their advantages and disadvantages. The written prospectus also includes possible complications of implantation.

         <p style="text-align: justify">In fortunate cases, we can proceed with implantation immediately after the tooth has been removed. This minimizes the loss of bone during healing, and the patient only has to experience the discomfort of surgical intervention once.</p>

         <h4 class="h-bold" style="margin-top:0px">Immediate Burdening</h4>
         <p style="text-align: justify">In the case of favourable terms, the implant can be burdened immediately, so you can get teeth shortly after the operation. The produced temporary denture is almost equivalent to the final in function and aesthetics. This allows the patient to endure several months with a comfortable solution until the implants have healed permanently. We also gain positive experience in developing aesthetic solutions for decades to come.</p>

         <h4 class="h-bold" style="margin-top:0px">Temporary Implantation</h4>
         <p style="text-align: justify">In the case of implantation or bone replacement, there may be no teeth of your own or implants available to attach the temporary dental replacement to. In this case, temporary implants are placed on parts of the jaw bone, where the permanent replacement will be not affected, with the aim of helping to keep the temporary tooth replacement in place. These implants are usually removed at the end of the healing period. A temporary implant may also be implanted if it is deemed necessary for 3D computer implant design or orthodontic treatment.</p>

         <h4 class="h-bold" style="margin-top:0px">Replacement of an individual tooth - Implant anchored crown</h4>
         <p style="text-align: justify">If the bone status is favourable, the best way to replace a missing tooth is to embed a dental artificial root (implant). This is particularly beneficial if the adjacent teeth are in full or near intact condition.
            <br><br>As opposed to the traditional bridge which is an alternative, the preservation of healthy teeth is an irrefutable value both cosmetically and functionally. The artificial root leaning on the implant can be equivalent to a natural tooth both in aesthetics and the ability to chew. In the front region, where the aesthetic expectations are the highest, both the structure of the implant and the crown can be made of metal-free material (zirconium).
            <br><br>The fixing of implant anchored teeth can also be done by means of adhesives or screws. The advantage of the latter is that the structure can be removed without damage in any case.

         <p style="text-align: justify">In case of larger scale toothlessness, there is no need to replace each missing tooth with an implant. In general, we can say that every second implant placed can carry the dental structure properly. However, there aren’t any obstacles to replace teeth one-by-one with implants.</p>

         <h4 class="h-bold" style="margin-top:0px">Replacement of all teeth - Implant-supported bridges</h4>
         <p style="text-align: justify">If there is no way to retain more than two teeth in a mandible, but the bone conditions are favourable, in most cases we choose implantation solutions only. This is more reliable and predictable in the long term. If the jaw bone condition is well maintained after tooth loss, it is possible to fix a bridge to the implants replacing the tooth.</p>

         <p style="text-align: justify">This is a recently developed popular procedure for the rehabilitation of complete toothless condition. Its particular advantage is that it allows the creation of fixed replacements by implanting a small number of large implants. In well-chosen cases it is possible to create instant fixed tooth replacements, so the end result is very spectacular. However, it is important to know that not all toothless conditions are suitable for this type of solution and that cleaning of the denture requires special care, some handiness and regular professional oral hygiene care.
            <br><br>The number of implants depends on the size of the implant to be embedded and the quality of the jaw bone. In general, we can make a fixed replacement by placing 6 implants in the upper jaw and 4 implants in the lower jaw. In order to achieve proper support, it is often necessary to adjust the axis of the implants, thus placing them at an angle different from the usual one.
            <br><br>This type of replacement will not only replace the missing teeth but also the hard and soft tissue (gums) around the lost tooth roots.
            <br><br>It is always fixed in an easily handled form (with a screw) by the dentist, which gives the possibility to clean the replacement at specific intervals by a professional in our office.
            <br><br>Another advantage is that necessary repairs of possible damages of the denture can be done easily through the possibility of screw fixing.

         <p style="text-align: justify">The most popular version of implants. With a few exceptions, it can be made for everyone.
            <br><br>Its greatest advantage is that functionally and aesthetically the same result can be achieved like in the case of fixed replacement, but without the inconvenience of wearing a fixed replacement. In this case, there is no need for a large amount of bone supplement, the aesthetic support of the lips can be easily achieved because the position of the implants can be independent of the aesthetic zone. It is extremely easy to clean, so inflammatory complications around implants are rare and manageable. Any repair can be done easily and cost-effectively without replacing the metal parts. This is the most effective way to restore the unfavourable aesthetic of the face in elderly people, for example, the bite height.
